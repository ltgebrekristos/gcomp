Using a traditional regression approach to estimate the effect of eviction on overall health can introduce bias because time-varying variables can be both a mediator and confounder. For example, previous exposure to an eviction can lead to a decrease in current income due to the stress of housing instability. Further, low income can lead to non-payment of rent and subsequent eviction. Finally, low income can independently impact self-reported poor health. Using parametric g-formula, I simulated the counterfactual outcomes to estimate the effect of eviction on health.
